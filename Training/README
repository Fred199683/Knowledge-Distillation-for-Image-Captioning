Below is the Description corresponding to each training file.

model.py
Contains class definitions of all models

train1.py

Training the image captioning teacher model. Combines
CNN and LSTM to build a caption generator.

train2.py
Training Student CNN Model using knowledge distillation.

train3.py
Training Student LSTM model using sequence level knowledge distillation

data1.py
Dataset helper for getting coco data. Used for training Image Captioning Teacher model (CNN + LSTM)
Also used as dataset helper for generating beam captions.

data2.py
Class helper for CNN distillation.

data3.py
This is used when training student LSTM model. It
loads the beamsearch captions for an image instead of ground truth

generate_beamsearch_captions.py 

This python script generates beam search database which is used in train3.py for sequence level distillation
